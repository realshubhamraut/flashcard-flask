    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "The output of the code is Hello foo and bin. Here, the format string uses index-based access to retrieve elements from the tuple passed as a single argument. {0[0]} and {0[1]} access the first and second elements of the tuple respectively.",

    "explanation": "In this code, map(str, x) converts each inner list [0] and [1] into strings: “[0]” and “[1]”. Then ‘ ‘.join(…) creates the string “[0] [1]”. Finally, it is wrapped in a tuple using the comma syntax, resulting in (‘[0] [1]’,).",

    },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "In Python, if both the try block and the finally block contain return statements, the return in the finally block overrides the one in the try block. So, even though return 1 is in the try, the function ends up returning 2 because of the finally block.",
