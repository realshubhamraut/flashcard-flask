    "topic": "Semiconductors",
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "hint": "This dopant has one *fewer* valence electron than silicon, creating a 'hole'.",
    "options": [
      "Trivalent (e.g., Boron)",
      "Tetravalent (e.g., Silicon)",
      "Pentavalent (e.g., Phosphorus)",
      "Haxavalent (e.g., Sulphur)"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Trivalent (e.g., Boron)",
    "description": "To create a p-type semiconductor, an intrinsic semiconductor (like silicon, valence 4) is doped with a trivalent (3-electron) impurity like Boron. This creates a vacancy or 'hole' in the covalent bond structure, which acts as a positive charge carrier.",

    "correct_answer": "Depletion region",
    "description": "The depletion region (or depletion layer) is the region on either side of a p-n junction that is left 'depleted' of free electrons and holes due to diffusion and recombination. It contains only the fixed, immobile donor and acceptor ions.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "$n_e = n_h$",
    "description": "In a pure (intrinsic) semiconductor, charge carriers are created when thermal energy breaks a covalent bond, producing one free electron and one hole. Therefore, the number density of electrons ($n_e$) is equal to the number density of holes ($n_h$).",
